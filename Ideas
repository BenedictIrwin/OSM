Ideas:

- We will impute the missing values in the file.

Things to try:

- We should probably ignore the qualifiers, some of the data are suspiciously round numbers, which don't have qualifiers anyway...
- For the points with multiple values X;Y;Z we can take the geometric average of the EC50, i.e. arithmetic average of pEC50.
