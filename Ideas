Ideas:

- We will impute the missing values in the file using the Alchemite technology.

Some of the entries appear to be duplicate simple SMILES. We should merge these rows [To Do]

Descriptors:
- For descriptors a first pass will be to use the StarDrop Automodeller descriptors. [DONE]


Test:

- As a first guess try a randomly held out 20% test set.
- Generate 5-fold CV on training set and check to see if any columns have no values in any of the test sets.
- The % data are very sparse


Consider:

- transform EC50 columns to pEC50 (i.e. 6-log_10(EC50))
- How to handle percentages?
- Some compounds have no data at all... Are these test compounds? 
- Might place these in a seperate file for training of any models.


Things to try:

- We should probably ignore the qualifiers, some of the data are suspiciously round numbers, which don't have qualifiers anyway... 
[ I have removed them for now, if it doesn't work I will go back]

- For the points with multiple values X;Y;Z we can take the geometric average of the EC50, i.e. arithmetic average of pEC50. [DONE]
