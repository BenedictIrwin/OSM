Ideas:

- We will impute the missing values in the file.

Things to try:

- We should probably ignore the qualifiers, some of the data are suspiciously round numbers, which don't have qualifiers anyway... 
[ I have removed them for now, if it doesn't work I will go back]


- For the points with multiple values X;Y;Z we can take the geometric average of the EC50, i.e. arithmetic average of pEC50. 

Descriptors:
- For descriptors a first pass will be to use the StarDrop Automodeller descriptors. [DONE]


Test:

- As a first guess try a randomly held out 20% test set.
- Generate 5-fold CV on training set and check to see if any columns have no values in any of the test sets.
- The % data are very sparse


Consider:

- transform EC50 columns to pEC50 (i.e. 6-log_10(EC50))
- How to handle percentages?
