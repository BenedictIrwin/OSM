Project Aims:
- We will impute the missing values in the file using the Alchemite technology as described in the publication: 
https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00768

Descriptors:
- For descriptors a first pass will be to use the StarDrop Automodeller descriptors. [DONE]

Test:
- As a first guess try a randomly held out 20% test set.
- Generate 5-fold CV on training set and check to see if any columns have no values in any of the test sets.
- The % data are very sparse (see if this is a problem) [To do]

Things to Consider:


Steps taken: ------------------------------------------------------------------

Data Transforms
- transform EC50 columns to pEC50 (i.e. 6-log_10(EC50))
- How to handle percentages? (used a logit transform for now)
- Some compounds have no data at all... Are these test compounds? 

(Removed these compounds, apparently not test compounds, but at least compounds of interest)
Placed these in a seperate file for training of any models.

- We should probably ignore the qualifiers, some of the data are suspiciously round numbers, which don't have qualifiers anyway... 
[ I have removed them for now, if it doesn't work I will go back]

For the points with multiple values X;Y;Z we can take the geometric average of the EC50, i.e. arithmetic average of pEC50. [DONE]

Some of the entries appear to be duplicate simple SMILES. We should merge these rows [DONE]
Note: The SMILES FC1=C(F)C=CC(C(OC)COC2=CN=CC3=NN=C(C4=CC=C(C#N)C=C4)N32)=C1 was the only duplicate, perhaps lost some stereochemistry etc.? 
I have merged the two rows into 1, using the geomean where appropriate.
