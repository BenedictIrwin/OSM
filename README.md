We will attempt to fill in the data matrix using some deep learning methods and provide this to the community.

We may attempt to use the Alchemite method as described in this publication: 
Imputation of Assay Bioactivity Data Using Deep Learning

Not due to confusions with the submission format we will try for a simpler method first.
01/10/2019: We will now attempt a QSAR vs. Quantum mechanical descriptor approach. We have taken the help of Mario Öeren on board who is an expert in drug metabolism and will help us with potential QM descriptors. This may include pka related endpoints.

Deadline appears to be 11th October.
