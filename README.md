Open Source Malaria 

This is a contribution to the https://github.com/OpenSourceMalaria/Series4_PredictiveModel/issues/1 event

We will attempt to fill in the data matrix using some deep learning methods and provide this to the community.

We *may* attempt to use the method as described in this publication: 
Imputation of Assay Bioactivity Data Using Deep Learning

Other deep and not deep multiple imputation methods and QSAR methodsto be considered.

Not due to confusions with the submission format we will try for a simpler mutli assay method first.
01/10/2019: We will now attempt a QSAR vs. Quantum mechanical descriptor approach. We have taken the help of Mario Öeren on board who is an expert in drug metabolism and will help us with potential QM descriptors. This may include pka related endpoints.

Deadline appears to be 11th October.

Have noted the Master chemical list is there but there are inconsistencies. 

I made changes to the Master chemicals list.

Some of the assays are to be trusted much more than others.
